# GifToRenPy

GifToRenPy is a Python 2 script that takes a .gif file and splits it into individual .png frames, so that an animation can be created from them in Ren'Py. The script also optionally creates a .rpy file with an image statement, defining the animation for you straight away. 

The script should work in Python 3 just fine, but easygui and Pillow modules would need to be re-installed, as versions included are for Python 2 only.

# Basically everything below is a placeholder.

## Installing Python 2

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
Placeholder.
```

```python
import placeholder

# returns 'words'
placeholder.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
placeholder.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
placeholder.singularize('phenomena')
```
